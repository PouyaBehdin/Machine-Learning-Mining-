The confidence value is saying that if the customer was to buy a stick of butter, the probability that they also purchase whole milk is 0.497248. Now, if the customer has already purchased butter the probability of purchasing whole milk will be increased by the lift value 1.946053 times. Also, if the customer purchased whole milk the probability of purchasing butter will be increased by the lift value 1.946053 times. The lift and support values have no directions, they can be interpreted either way. However, confidence must consider direction, from left to right. Therefore, using these values of the first rule we can see that butter and whole milk are an interesting rule and as a business owner you can use this information to strategically place the products

Interpret the first rule based on the values of the support, confidence, and lift.<br>\n","\n","The support value of the first rule shows that the chances of a customer purchasing root vegetables,other vegetables, and whole milk together in any transaction are 0.023183. The confidence value is saying that if the customer was to buy root vegetables and other vegetables, the probability that they also purchase whole milk is 0.489270. Now, if the customer has already purchased root vegetables and other vegetables the probability of purchasing whole milk will be increased by the lift value 1.914833 times. Also, if the customer purchased whole milk the probability of purchasing root vegetables and other vegetables will be increased by the lift value 1.914833 times. The lift and support values have no directions, they can be interpreted either way. However, confidence must consider direction, from left to right. Therefore, using these values of the first rule we can see that root vegetables and other vegetables, and whole milk are an interesting rule and as a business owner you can use this information to strategically market the products in the store to consumers."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"J_uNzkWOKHtf","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":142},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1636492137843,"user_tz":480,"elapsed":10,"user":{"displayName":"Pouya","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14GglBwSpgzobpVW4jrzLube5ZSSjssD-HMQa5Bhk=s64","userId":"12959155926380749048"}},"outputId":"5cc8b6ea-580b-4231-806a-196e12af9abf"},"source":["# Find and display rules containing \"other vegetables\" on the right-hand side\n","all_rules[all_rules['RHS'].str.contains('other vegetables')]"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/html":["<div>\n","<style scoped>\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n","        vertical-align: middle;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n","        vertical-align: top;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe thead th {\n","        text-align: right;\n","    }\n","</style>\n","<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n","  <thead>\n","    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n","      <th></th>\n","      <th>LHS</th>\n","      <th>RHS</th>\n","      <th>support</th>\n","      <th>confidence</th>\n","      <th>lift</th>\n","    </tr>\n","  </thead>\n","  <tbody>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>6</th>\n","      <td>root vegetables</td>\n","      <td>other vegetables</td>\n","      <td>0.047382</td>\n","      <td>0.434701</td>\n","      <td>2.246605</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>7</th>\n","      <td>whipped/sour cream</td>\n","      <td>other vegetables</td>\n","      <td>0.028876</td>\n","      <td>0.402837</td>\n","      <td>2.081924</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>13</th>\n","      <td>whole milk,root vegetables</td>\n","      <td>other vegetables</td>\n","      <td>0.023183</td>\n","      <td>0.474012</td>\n","      <td>2.449770</td>\n","    </tr>\n","  </tbody>\n","</table>\n","</div>"],"text/plain":["                           LHS               RHS  ...  confidence      lift\n","6              root vegetables  other vegetables  ...    0.434701  2.246605\n","7           whipped/sour cream  other vegetables  ...    0.402837  2.081924\n","13  whole milk,root vegetables  other vegetables  ...    0.474012  2.449770\n","\n","[3 rows x 5 columns]"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":19}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"GL0ebMrZK6OA"},"source":["# Use the apriori command to generate about 30 to 50 association rules.

Select an interesting rule and explain how it can benefit the grocery store.<br>\n","<br>\n","An interesting rule is the association between sausages and rolls/buns. The support value of the two bought together is 0.030605. Showing that it is a rather commonly bought transaction. In addition, if a customer purchases sausages the probability of them purchasing rolls/buns is 0.325758. Therefore, the confidence level is quite high. They can maximize sales of rolls/buns if they place them near the sausages. Or they can place the rolls/buns a little further apart so customers have to go through a different set of products that maybe they will buy on their way to find the rolls/buns section since they are highly likely to purchase rolls/buns if they are already planning on buying sausages.\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"0M2GbKLVF1em"},"source":["***Download the html file and submit to BeachBoard***<br>\n","<br>\n","1.   ***Download the lab9.ipynb file***\n","2.   ***Upload the lab9.ipynb file***\n","3.   ***Run the code below to generate a html file***\n","4.   ***Download the html file and submit to BeachBoard***"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"MNRp8uoa-0g0","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1636562699277,"user_tz":480,"elapsed":1064,"user":{"displayName":"Pouya","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14GglBwSpgzobpVW4jrzLube5ZSSjssD-HMQa5Bhk=s64","userId":"12959155926380749048"}},"outputId":"a83fb63f-ee56-47c9-e2b5-ffad17816254"},"source":["!jupyter nbconvert --to html IS470_lab9.ipynb"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["[NbConvertApp] Converting notebook IS470_lab9.ipynb to html\n","[NbConvertApp] Writing 368403 bytes to IS470_lab9.html\n"]}]}]}
